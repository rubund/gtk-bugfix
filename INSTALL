Prerequisites
=============

GTK+ requires the following packages:

 - The GLib, Pango, GdkPixbuf, ATK and cairo libraries, available at
   the same location as GTK+. GTK+ 3.14.5 requires at least
   GLib 2.41.2, Pango 1.36.7,
   GdkPixbuf 2.30.0, ATK 2.12.0
   and cairo 1.12.0.

 - Each GDK backend has its own backend-specific requirements. For
   the X11 backend, X11 R6 and XInput version 2 (as well as a number
   of other extensions) are required.

 - gobject-introspection 1.39.0 or newer.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % tar xf gtk+-3.14.5.tar.xz   # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-3.14.5              # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                        # run the `configure' script
  % make                               # build GTK+
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                       # install GTK+
